I am currently pursuing a Master of Environmental Science and Management at the Bren school (UCSB). I graduated magna cum laude from The University of California, San Diego in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Systems (Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution). Through my diverse work experiences, I have become interested in the use of ArcGIS to understand social ecological systems and environmental economic issues. I am interested in further developing my Spanish language skills for use in future jobs and research. At the Bren school, I am pursuing specializations in Economics and Politics of the Environment and Coastal Marine Resource Management.
